React Coroutine is a small library which leverages the power of modern
JavaScript to provide seamless way in creating stateful components with
different purposes.

This library just use a coroutine as a React component. No API to learn and
keep up to date, no additional workflows or blackboxes to worry about.

## Install

Use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install
the library from NPM [registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-coroutine).

    npm install react-coroutine

## Usage

    import React from 'react';
    import Coroutine from 'react-coroutine';
    import Posts from 'PostAPI';
    import PostList from 'PostList.react';

    async function PostListCo() {
      try {
        const posts = await Posts.retrieve();
        return <PostList posts={posts} />;
      } catch (error) {
        return <p>Unable to fetch posts.</p>;
      }
    }

    export default Coroutine.create(PostListCo);

## Requirements

If your project uses tools like [Babel](babeljs.io/) for code compilation, make sure your configuration supports `async`/`await` syntax (for async functions or generators). Plugins like [transform-async-to-generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-to-generator/) and [transform-async-generator-functions](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-generator-functions/) can help you with it and they might be already a part of presets your configuration uses.
